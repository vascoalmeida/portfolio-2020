# Portfolio

Welcome to my work-in-progress portfolio! This is the side-project I'm currently working on. I am using this as an opportunity to try out all the new things I've been wanting to implement. Highlights include:
- SPA with SSR
- Dynamic handling of 3D objects

I must warn you that, as it's a WIP, things are not yet in their final form and are prone to changes. There are things that are most definitely sub-optimal and could use improvements. Here's a small list:
- Reusability of shaders
- Some architecture decisions that I now regret

I'm taking my time to think carefuly on what I would do. Take this more as a learning experience for me than an actual project I'd work on
